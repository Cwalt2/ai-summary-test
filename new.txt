The solar system is a vast and fascinating place, consisting of our Sun and everything bound to it by gravity. This includes eight major planets, their moons, dwarf planets, and countless asteroids, comets, and meteoroids. The inner solar system is home to the four terrestrial planets: Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars, which are characterized by their rocky composition. Beyond the asteroid belt lie the four gas giants: Jupiter and Saturn, and the ice giants: Uranus and Neptune, all of which are much larger and have no solid surface. Each of these celestial bodies has unique features, from the rings of Saturn to the great red spot of Jupiter, making the study of our cosmic neighborhood a continuous journey of discovery.
